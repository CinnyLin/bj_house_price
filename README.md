## Introduction

This paper looks into a real-world dataset of 10,682 observations about Beijing’s housing prices in 2016, obtained from Lianjia, a primary real estate dealer in China. In the dataset, we noticed that the per square meter housing prices in Beijing is highly inconsistent, with someas reaching as high as 150,000, and others as low as 10,000. Although such inconsistency is not uncommon in other big cities like Shanghai or Shenzhen, housing prices in Beijing areparticularly worth investigating, due to two reasons: the coexistence of modern apartment complexes and ancient bungalow houses (Siheyuan), and the concentric city layout. We believe that these characteristics may lead to different sets of variables affecting Beijing’s housing prices disproportionately compared to other big cities. Thus, we pose the question: **what are the key factors that influence per unit housing prices in Beijing?**
